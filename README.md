# EM-Framework

EM Framework is the main framework used by all the EM Mods

EM Framework is also a great util for server owners and modders as it contains a whole bunch of methods setup for modders to make use of super easily


# Code Practice

All PRs should come from your own fork and be PR'd in

Main Repo will contain up to 3 Branches:

Main - Main Working Branch
Rework - Refactoring/Rework branch
Version x - Staging Builds for the next Eco Version

# Notes
